# Stash Catalog

[stashed/catalog](https://github.com/stashed/catalog) is a collection of plugins for [Stash by AppsCode](https://appscode.com/products/stash/). This installs necessary `Function` and `Task` definitions that enable Stash to backup various targets such as databases, cluster resources, etc.

## Available Catalogs
